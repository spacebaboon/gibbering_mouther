# gibbering_mouther

Dungeon Master's tool for the madness inducing voices of a gibbering mouther. These foul creatures have hundreds of eyes and mouths, and drive you mad!

Uses browser MediaRecorder API to record a voice sample, e.g. a player character's name, and then plays this back, layered dozens of times simultaneously with random length and pitch adjustments.
